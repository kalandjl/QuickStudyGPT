    "Differentiate between ionic, covalent, and polar covalent bonds": {
        "yourAnswer": "Ionic bonds involve the complete transfer of electrons from one atom to another, resulting in the formation of ions (charged particles). Covalent bonds involve the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. Polar covalent bonds are a type of covalent bond where electrons are shared unequally between atoms, resulting in regions of partial positive and negative charges.",
        "correct": true,
        "critique": "Your answer is accurate and succinct."
    },
    "Describe the formation and effect of positive and negative dipoles": {
        "yourAnswer": "Positive and negative dipoles occur due to uneven distribution of electrons in a covalent bond, creating regions of partial positive and negative charges. This impacts the overall polarity and behavior of the molecule.",
        "correct": true,
        "critique": "Your response is clear in explaining the concept of positive and negative dipoles."

    "List six characteristics of water and explain their significance to organisms": {
        "yourAnswer": "1. High polarity and hydrogen bonding. 2. High specific heat capacity. 3. High heat of vaporization. 4. Excellent solvent properties. 5. High surface tension. 6. Anomalous expansion upon freezing. These characteristics are vital for biological processes such as temperature regulation, transport of nutrients and waste, and structural support.",
        "correct": true,
        "critique": "You have correctly identified and explained the important characteristics of water in relation to organisms."
    },
    "Contrast acids and bases in terms of pH and chemical properties; explain the roles of buffers": {
        "yourAnswer": "Acids have a pH below 7, donate protons (H+ ions), taste sour, and turn litmus paper red. Bases have a pH above 7, accept protons, taste bitter, and turn litmus paper blue. Buffers help maintain pH stability by resisting changes in acidity or basicity through absorbing excess H+ or OH- ions.",
        "correct": true,
        "critique": "Your explanation effectively distinguishes between acids and bases while also providing the role of buffers."
    },
    "Assess a molecular structure or formula as organic or inorganic": {
        "yourAnswer": "Molecules that contain carbon (except for oxides, carbides, and carbonates) are considered organic; those without carbon are classified as inorganic.",
        "correct": true,
        "critique": "Your answer is concise and accurately defines the criteria for determining whether a structure is organic or inorganic."
